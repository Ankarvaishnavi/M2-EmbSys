## Components used in simulation

### Atmega328
- The Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller combines 32 KB ISP flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1 KB EEPROM, 2 KB SRAM, 23 general-purpose I/O lines, 32 general-purpose working registers, 3 flexible timer/counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, serial programmable USART, a byte-oriented 2-wire serial interface, SPI serial port, 6-channel 10-bit A/D converter (8 channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages), programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, and 5 software-selectable power-saving modes. 
- The device operates between 1.8 and 5.5 volts. The device achieves throughput approaching 1 MIPS/MHz

### Ultrasonic sensor

- An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves.
- An ultrasonic sensor uses a transducer to send and receive ultrasonic pulses that relay back information about an object's proximity.

### L293 Motor driver

- The L293D is a popular 16-Pin Motor Driver IC. As the name suggests it is mainly used to drive motors. 
- A single L293D IC is capable of running two DC motors at the same time; also the direction of these two motors can be controlled independently.

### Potentiometer

- When used to vary voltage, a potentiometer can be connected to a motor and vary the voltage and therefore power delivered to a motor which will control its speed.
