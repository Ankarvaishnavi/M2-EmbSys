## INTRODUCTION

### Problem statement
- Sudden appearance of obstacle while driving is a major reason for vehicle accidents.
- The response time varies from person to person in this situation.
- At that point of time, controlling the vehicle becomes a difficult task.

### Solution
In this proposed system I am trying to lower the number of accidence by giving the alert to the driver and decrease the speed of the vehicle.

### Abstract
The proposed system helps the drier to avoid the accidents by controlling the car on time. The accident prevention system includes ultrasonic wave emitter installed in front of the car producing and emitting the ultrasonic waves. It will also receive ultrasonic waves and gives the distance between the obstacle and car.

The micro-controller is used to operate in such a way that it can controls the speed of car based on the information detected.

In this system include ultrasonic sensors and buzzer is used as an input. These are used to receive the signals if any obstacle comes under the range and will give the alert signal to the driver so that driver can take necessary actions to avoid accidents.
This system also includes motor driver and potentiometer to control the speed of the car.

### 5W’s and 1H

1. What?
- Accident prevention system

2. Where?
- In any vehicle like car, bike, truck, etc

3. When?
- When any obstacle appears while driving

4. Who?
- People who wants to have a safe drive

5. Why?
- To avoid accidents

6. How?
- With the help of ultrasonic sensors and micro-controller
