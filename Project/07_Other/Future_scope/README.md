## Accidents prevention system can be implemented on major level

## Abstract
- Accidents nowadays are mostly caused by the driver's failure to hit the brakes or by the driver's negligence. 
- The project's goal is to create a prototype system that provides collision functionality in production vehicles, a system that can operate automatically with the help of high-profile sensors based on relay circuits and some changes in traditional braking systems, and a system that can apply the brake automatically in an emergency situation. The resulting system is capable of high-accuracy measurements as well as improved short-distance measurement. 
- This measurement of distance is used to control a smart braking system for safety applications. The system's brain can be built on an Arduino Nano microcontroller.
The Ultrasonic sensors are the system's eyes, and they are less expensive and require less demanding technology. 
- The 3/2solenoid valve, which actuates the brakes and clutch, is used for braking.

## Introduction
- Vehicle technology has advanced rapidly in recent years, particularly in terms of braking and sensing systems. ASS (active safety systems) are being researched and developed to help prevent accidents and mitigate damage. 
- The project seeks to distinguish between current systems in production, such as traction control (TC), electronic brake force distribution (EBD), anti-lock braking system (ABS), and electronic stability control (ESC), and future systems in development. 
- When considering a vehicle, the braking system is such an important component that it is unavoidable. It reduces the kinetic energy of the vehicle in situations where the vehicle must slow down or stop.

## Components can be used in this project: 
1. Ultrasonic sensor 
2. Arduinonano 
3. 3/2Solenoid valve 
4. Single acting pneumatic cylinde
