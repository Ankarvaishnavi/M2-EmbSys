## Accidents 
## Abstract
Accidents nowadays are mostly caused by the driver's failure to hit the brakes or by the driver's negligence. 
The project's goal is to create a prototype system that provides collision functionality in production vehicles, a system that can operate automatically with the help of high-profile sensors based on relay circuits and some changes in traditional braking systems, and a system that can apply the brake automatically in an emergency situation. The resulting system is capable of high-accuracy measurements as well as improved short-distance measurement. 
This measurement of distance is used to control a smart braking system for safety applications. The system's brain can be built on an Arduino Nano microcontroller.
