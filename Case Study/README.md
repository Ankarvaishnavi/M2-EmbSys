##  INTRODUCTION:

- Washing machine provides extensive support in home automation applications. It mainy contains sensors, actuators, control unit and application specific user interfaces like keyboards, display units. LED’s for accepting user’s inputs and providing visual indications.

- These user interfaces are used to find and  giving inputs and outputs.
- It contain sensors like water level sensors, temperature sensors, ph sensors, etc.

- Contains actuators like spin and agitators, control motor units. Actuators are the electric pulses that controls any particular devices. eg. Solenoid valves, agitatiors .

- Embedded controllers for controlling the washing operations.

- Sensors, actuators and I/O devices are interfaced to the I/P sub-system of embedded control unit.
- Once you prepare a particular microcontroller for particular task then it cannot be used in any other applications. That means the microcontroller that is used in washing machine cannot be used in any other applications.
