## Introducton:This system gives better reliable security system against fire accidents. There are some sensors which senses fire. If the fire starts, motor turn on. If there is not firing then motor will kept off.

### Components Required
##### Microcontroller- Decision making
##### Crystal oscillator- Crystal oscillator works on piezoelectric effect
##### Resistors
##### Diodes
##### Transformers
##### Capacitors
- Used to remove the ripples. Mainly used to pass the AC and block DC
- An electrolytic capacitor is used for filtering to give pure DC
- A ceremic capacitor is used to remove the spikes so that the supply of section is 5V regulated DC. 
##### Connectors- It is used to connect the step down transformer to the bridge rectifier
##### DC Motors- If fire starts the motor will turn on otherwise it will remain off
##### Relay
##### Buzzer
##### Flame sensors- Sensing fire and smoke
