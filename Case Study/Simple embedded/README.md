## About

### Description
- Smart card is one of the most used embedded
system today. It is used for credit, debit bank card,
e-wallet card, identification card, medical card (for
history and diagnosis details) and card for a
number of new innovative application.

### Features
- Enhanced security
- Offline transaction
- Multifunction
- Customization
- Economical
- Portable

### 4W's and 1H

#### What?
- An card having an integrated circuit chip embedded in it and conforming to ISO.
#### Where?
- Banking & Retail
- Healthcare
- ID Verification & Access Control
- Mobile Communications
#### Why?
- It can also be used as a security token and store certificates for secure web browsing
#### Who?
- People who wants to secure their data and provide personal identification without risk
#### How?
- Contact smart cards are inserted into a smart card reader, making a phisical contact with the reader.

#### I/O System
- The smart card includes specific components to execute the functions of input/output. It includes an internal logic circuit to work in combination with the microprocessor for controlling the timing as well as data flow that is transferred into the memory of the card. The physical structure of this card can easily interface to a card reader and it is connected to host computers to exchange the data.

#### CPU (Central Processing Unit )
- The microprocessor otherwise a CPU is the component that differentiates the smart cards from other types of cards that are mainly used to store the data. The microprocessor is in connection through the operating system that allows the smart-card to make its own choices regarding where the information is stored within memories & under what conditions it must transfer data through its I/O interface. The microprocessor includes three main components such as ALU (arithmetic logic unit), the control unit & the bus.

#### Memory
- The memories which are employed in these cards are mainly manufactured by using semiconductor materials. These memories include matrices of cells that are formed through transistors to store the data. The semiconductor memories which are used in these cards are two types which include the following.

     1. ROM (Read Only Memory)
     2. RAM (Random Access Memory)

## Advantages and disadvantages

### Advantages
- More Secure
- Adaptable
- Administration & Control over cash expenditure.
- Less Weight
- Privacy
- Portable
### Disadvantages
- These are small and less weight
- Bank fees linked with a credit card.
- Information cannot be retrieved from the stolen card
- It needs a smart card reader
- It should be recharged
- It can be damaged by fluids
- Production cost is enhanced
- It uses electrical energy to operate
